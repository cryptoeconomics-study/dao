# Cryptoeconomics.Study DAO

This repo is for things related to the [Cryptoeconomics.Study DAO](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xEAA147020b006e6Bfe9e3e1A9f1FaD330A9E20F5/).

In the future we will have deployment templates for other communities to recreate the Cryptoeconomics.Study DAO model.

We might even start working on our own Aragon apps here.
