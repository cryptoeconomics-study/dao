# Cryptoeconomics.Study DAO

This repo is for Issues related to the Cryptoeconomics.Study DAO.

In the future we will have deployment templates for other communities to recreate the Cryptoeconomics.Study DAO model.

We might even start working on our own Aragon apps here.

## Bounties ðŸ¥•

We have lots of awesome things on our to-do list. If you want to get involved we would be happy to help you get started on any of the [open Issues](https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-study-dao/bounties/issues) in our [Bounties repo](https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-study-dao/bounties). Some Issues have a set Carrot budget while others are open ended. If you want to start working on an open Issue just comment right there in the Issue. We'll then do our best by answering questions, providing feedback, and minting you Carrots along the way!  ðŸ¥•

Also if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement regarding Carrot bounties please let us know by commenting on the [Carrot Bounties ðŸ¥•](https://forum.cryptoeconomics.study/t/open-carrot-bounties/523) thread on the forum :)
