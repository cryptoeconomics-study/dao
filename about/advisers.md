<br />

Advisers are an essential group in the Cryptoeconomics.Study DAO. Advisers help shape product decisions, promote upcoming product releases, and provide perspective on important debates within the community. Advisers are trusted members of the community, but are not expected to be involved in day to day activities. The expected engagement for advisers is to check in about once a month. This will help Gerbils and Carrot holders make good decisions that are best for the community.

Gerbils will mint 1000 Carrot tokens per month for active Advisers. This will give Advisers a meaningful percentage of voting weight in Carrot votes as Carrot supply increases. Advisers are required to hodl their Carrot tokens in order to be able to maintain their position as Advisers. This is crucial because Carrot tokens are required to participate in Carrot votes. If an Adviser disagrees with the direction of the project they can trade or burn their Carrot tokens. This signals that they no longer want to be a part of the project and makes them ineligible for future Adviser shares of Carrot tokens.

Roles and responsibilities of advisers includes:
- reviewing and providing feedback on all major product releases via a post on the community forum
- promoting all major product releases via a tweet or blog post
- providing council and insight on debates that could potentially fork the community (via the community forum)
