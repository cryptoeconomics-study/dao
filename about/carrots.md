## What is a Carrot?

Carrots are the community contribution tokens. Anyone can earn Carrots by contributing to Cryptoeconoimcs.Study. Carrots are rewarded for completing bounties and doing awesome things in the community. Holding carrots allows you to participate in [Carrot allocations](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xEAA147020b006e6Bfe9e3e1A9f1FaD330A9E20F5/0x2225ca26a71af7dd81cf2ebbcd4b16d0090cfe10) (weekly Carrot minting) and [Carrot votes](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xEAA147020b006e6Bfe9e3e1A9f1FaD330A9E20F5/0x7147928551406adaeca76cf3e04557bd3412cf53) (community governance).

Carrot tokens are transferable and are expected to trade freely. You can send Carrots to community members as a thank you. Eventually Carrots might even trade on open markets. Be careful though! Carrots are currently only available on Rinkeby.
