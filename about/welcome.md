Hi! Welcome to the Cryptoeconomics.Study community.

We believe that cryptoeconomic tools are essential for human coordination and cooperation at scale. We're building Cryptoeconomics.Study to help people learn about and contribute to research and development of these mechanisms. We are self organized via a DAO to create transparency around decision making and to allow all contributors to have a say in governance and decision making.

The Cryptoeconomics.Study DAO can be found here:
- https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xEAA147020b006e6Bfe9e3e1A9f1FaD330A9E20F5/

It is an [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) DAO built on [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/#stats), one of [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)'s testing networks.

To participate in the DAO you'll need a browser (we recommend [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Brave](https://brave.com/)), an Ethereum wallet that can sign transactions (we recommend [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)), and some [Rinkeby ETH](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) (if you can't access the [faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) just ask on the forum and we'll send you some).
