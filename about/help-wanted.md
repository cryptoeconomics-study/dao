There's lots of ways to get involved in the Cryptoeconomics.Study community. The most import Issues are curated in our [DAO](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xEAA147020b006e6Bfe9e3e1A9f1FaD330A9E20F5/). We do this by staking Carrots to open GitHub Issues in the [Projects app](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xEAA147020b006e6Bfe9e3e1A9f1FaD330A9E20F5/0x32016d05910e344470ec832ed344a385ab18ae6b). If you'd like to contribute please visit the Projects app in the DAO, find an open GitHub Issue that has a bounty attached, and request assignment. A Gerbil will then reach out to make sure you understand the task and approve your request. Then you're good to go and can start working! Once you're done just let us know and a Gerbil will review your work and pay out your Carrots ðŸ¥• :)

<br />

We also have a lot of archived projects that could use some support. The contributing guide on the forum lists these, and if you want to contribute or thing we should create Carrot bounties for these please let us know!
